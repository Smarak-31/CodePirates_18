        <p>In modern usage, a short kurta is referred to as the kurti, which is the attire of females. However, traditionally, the term kurti refers to waist coats,[1] jackets and blouses[2] which sit above the waist without side slits, and are believed to have descended from the tunic of the Shunga period (2nd century B.C.).[3] The kurti is distinguished from the choli by the latter leaving the midriff exposed.

            It is a typical dressing pattern of Indians especially the northern regions.
            
            The trend and origin of this clothing style is from the northern India and even today the other parts of the nation though modernalized wear kurti but it is worn by females majorly in north while the south prefers saree.The Kurti or Kurta is an outfit that has stretched beyond the Indian borders, and has evolved down the ages to suit the ever-changing demands of the fashion forward world. A long top, generally of knee-length, paired with Salwar or Churidar and Dupatta is what comprises the Salwar-Kurti-Dupatta get-up.Since its formation in ancient times, the kurta has been one of the traditional attires for men and women living in countries like India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and even Sri Lanka. Initially, this Indian outfit was a form of clothing worn only by men living in these countries, but later it became a regular attire for women, for which it has its own feminine term known as Kurti.

            Looking back at the early 19th Century, the Kurta gained popularity as several scholars, artists and poets were famous for donning this piece of clothing. Contrary to the various styles and forms found today, this Indian Kurti back then was usually very simple with barely any elaborate designs. The most common fabric used to make it was Cotton, followed by Silk, which was only used to make Kurtas for special occasions, or for people with higher social standing and wealth.
            
            In addition to that, the hippie movement during the 1960’s and 1970’s also gave this tunic dress immense popularity as people wore these loose and comfortable pieces as reflecting their laid back and carefree attitude.
            
            The intriguing fact about the Kurti is that it was not limited to any particular state or region, unlike other dress forms that have a set identity; it was a common form of attire followed by people living in all kinds of areas.</p>

    <p>Dupatta is a long scarf-like cloth usually worn by women in Southern Asia. Commonly known as the chunnari, odhni and chunni; Dupatta is considered a symbol of modesty and compliments the overall look of a salwar kameez or lehanga choli. The dupatta is a colorful swathe of cloth which inspires romance, a fact that has been showcased from a long time, and since the arrival of cinema.

        A dupatta is an extremely versatile piece of clothing. It can be worn in a number of ways, with a number of different garments, in a number of styles. The myriad designs, patterns, colors and decorations are overwhelming with respect to the dupatta!
        
        Each region has its own way of presenting the chunari with unique embellishments, embroideries, fabrics and weaves. The most common fabrics for chunari are Cotton, Silk, Chiffon and Georgette.The traditional dupatta has been worn in innumerable parts of South Asia since centuries. The people of Vedic India wore three garments – nivil, vasas, and adhivasa. The adhivasa was a garment similar to the dupatta of present times. During the vedic times, the dupatta was worn both by men and women, unlike the present day scenario.

        The dupatta with time gradually evolved and went on from being a fabric for practical purposes to something that complimented the overall dressing of a woman such as coordinating suits. The billowing length has been reduced from two and a half metres to around two metres.
        
        At first, the dupatta was used to cover the head and upper body, and was worn with ghagra choli or salwar kameez. The motive was modesty and also a mark of respect towards the family elders. The age old practice of ladies covering their heads while going to a place of worship still exists.
        It is perplexing and overwhelming to talk about the kind of variety that the dupatta embodies. It wasn’t extremely long ago that the dupatta was a significant aspect of the tradition and value system of every Hindu family. With time it made its appearance in the arena of fashion and was showcased on the big screen by dazzling divas. The gracious garments soon underwent a lot of contemplation to don different faces.

<p>A traditional kurta is composed of rectangular fabric pieces with perhaps a few gusset inserts, and is cut so as to leave no waste fabric. The cut is usually simple, although decorative treatments can be elaborate.

    The sleeves of a traditional kurta fall straight to the wrist; they do not narrow, as do many Western-cut sleeves. Sleeves are not cuffed, just hemmed and decorated.
    
    The front and back pieces of a simple kurta are also rectangular. The side seams are left open for 6-12 inches above the hem, also referred to as the chāk, which gives the wearer some ease of movement. (Note: chāk derives from the Persian "چاك ćāk, Fissure, cleft, rent, slit, a narrow opening intentionally left in clothes)."[16]
    
    The kurta usually opens in the front; some styles, however, button at the shoulder seam. The front opening is often a hemmed slit in the fabric, tied or buttoned at the top; some kurtas, however, have plackets rather than slits. The opening may be centered on the chest, or positioned off center.
    
    A traditional kurta does not have a collar. Modern variants may feature stand-up collars of the type known to tailors and seamstresses as "mandarin" collars. These are the same sort of collars seen on achkans, sherwanis, and Nehru jackets.Kurta-Pajama, consisting of two pieces of garments, is one of the basic clothing of the Indian men. The first garment is a kurta that is like a loose long shirt almost reaching the knees, whereas the second one is the pajama or pyjama, which is a lightweight drawstring trouser. Though mostly worn on formal occasions, kurta pajama can also be worn casually. Infact, there are many Indian men who wear this dress as their sleepwear.

    The term 'pyjama' crept into the English language from Hindustani, a language from which Urdu and Hindi originated. The word originally derives from the Persian word 'Payjama' meaning 'leg garment'. It was due to the British colonialization of India that the term 'pajama' and the dress spread to other parts of the world. In India, one will often find politicians wearing white starched Kurta Pajama. As a tradition, civilians wear this dress during festivities and other special occasions like holi, religious ceremony, etc.
    
    Only soft material fabrics are used for making kurta pajama as it is supposed to be a comfortable loose fitting dress. Though good quality cotton is the most common material used for making kurta pajama, other fabrics like silk and satin are also used. Normally adults prefer wearing the kurta and pajama in neutral shades, as they give a very dignified look. Children, on the other hand, wear this dress in varied hues and patterns. Kolhapuri chappals are the most preferred footwear for this type of attire.</p>
