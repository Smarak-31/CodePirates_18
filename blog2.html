   <p>A handicraft more precisely expressed as artisanal handicraft or handmade, is any of a wide variety of types of useful and decorative works which are made completely by hand or by using only simple devices. It is a traditional activity, which applies to a variety of creative and design activities with one’s own hands and skills, including work with textiles, mouldable and rigid materials paper, plant fibres, etc. Usually the term is applied to traditional techniques of creating items that are both practical and aesthetic, whether for personal use or for products. 
    Handcraft originates from the countryside pursuit, the matter-goods pre-requisite, of age old civilisations, and many specific crafts have been practised…show more content…
    Some of the most popular crafts are metal work, earthenware, pottery, sculpting, wood work, hand printed textiles and scarves, shawls, zari products, stone carvings, and jewelleries. Today, whatever status Indian handicraft industry has in the market, owes to the rich crafts history and traditions of the past of the country. Majority of the handicrafts from the ancient times continues to proliferate due to their serviceable characteristics, availability to the population and flourishing in the domestic and global…show more content…
    Unlike in the past, Indian handicrafts today are being nurtured by different government and non-governmental organizations. The area is monetarily dominant from the point of view of less money investment, and high potential for export and foreign exchange earnings to the country. The export stipend from handicrafts industry of India for the period 1998-99 amounted to US$ 1.2 billion. The market is developing due to the huge demand of its products.

    <p>Wind chimes produce clear, pure tones when struck by a mallet or suspended clapper. A wind chime usually consists of a set of individual alloy rods, tuned by length to a series of intervals considered pleasant. These are suspended from a devised frame in such a way that a centrally suspended clapper can reach and impact all the rods. When the wind blows, the clapper is set in motion and randomly strikes one or more of the suspended rods-- causing the rod to vibrate and emit a tone.

        The pitch of said tone is governed by the length of the rod, but the perceived loudness is affected by many determinants: the force of the clappers impact, the alloy's density and structure, and the speed and direction of the wind (to name a few). Also affecting the loudness is the lack of resonating chamber or hard connection between rods and frame. The chime would certainly be louder, for instance, if the rods were built with the inclusion of small chambers containing a volume of air whose fundamental harmonic was the same as that of the rod-- when struck, the rod would transfer vibration to the enclosed air as well as directly to the atmosphere, resulting in a louder tone. A hard connection between rods and frame would also accomplish this result somewhat; the vibrations of each seperate rod would be commuted to the others, resulting in more vibrating surface area (and hence, more volume).

        <p>The reuse of objects found around your home is a great way to add some creative interior decor that’s unique and tailored to your taste. In this post, we’re going to discuss how you can create superb works of art using old glass bottles that may be lying around. From unique flower vases to creative art decor for your shelves, this article is a guide to help you learn how much fun painting on glass bottles can be.Before you kick things off, you’ll need to decide where you’re going to place this art. This will help you choose the appropriate colours for your bottles to help accentuate the area and highlight that space.The first thing you have to do before you begin painting is washing the bottle thoroughly, removing any excess gum or label residue and any grease and debris. For the best result, you should rinse both the outside and inside of the bottle with soap. We recommend using latex gloves when you start decorating the bottle, for safety. Only start after the bottle is completely dry.</p>

    <p>Dream catchers have been on this Earth for many years so far and will be on this Earth for many years to come. It is a tradition to hang a dream catcher over top of your bed and let it catch your dreams as you sleep. To get to the sleeper the dream must pass through the catcher. When you have a good dream it passes through the hole in the center of the catcher and glides down the feathers. On the other hand, when you have a bad dream it gets tangled in the web of the catcher. "When the sun comes up it shines on the catcher and all of the bad dreams caught in the web will expire or disappear." (Michaele,http://www.support-native-american-art.com) There are many different legends that are known to lead to the existence of the dream catcher. The most familiar legend tells about a spider that was spinning a web as Nokomis watched it each day. Then, Nokomis ' grandson went over to the spider and went to hit it but she said no. The spider thanked the grandmother for saving his life and told her that he will give her a gift. The gift was the web that he had been spinning for many days. The spider explained that this gift to the lady will entangle bad dreams into the web. Also, the good dreams that she has will go through the small hole in the center. Another story being told about the dream catcher is the Lakota Legend. The story about this legend started out with an old Lakota spiritual leader that had a vision up on a high mountain. Iktomi, the teacher of wisdom appeared in the form of a spider in this vision. "Iktomi took Elder 's hoop which had feathers, horse hairs, beads, and offering on it and began to spin a web." (Unltd, http://www.cynaunltd.com/dreamcatcher_legends.htm.) The Lakota leader passed his vision on to some people and the Sioux Indians use dream catchers as the web of life. They thought the dream catcher was the destiny to the future. </p>

<p>Today I’m welcoming you into my sacred space, a space I have created with intention of bringing quiet, reflection and connection within myself.  My husband made me this beautiful triangle shelf out of old barn wood that once belonged to my father, so it has so much sentimental value to it.  I have adorned it with my crystals and twinkle lights.  Adding a few handmade pieces from Novica completed this space for me.  The beautiful long dark wooden tealight holder creates such a warming, soothing ambiance in this space.  I fell in love with the fact that it’s name is Rain because that is what one of my most special friend’s goes by, Rain.  So not only do I admire the tealight holder itself, but I also think of her when I look at it.

    I also added this beautiful handmade crescent moon incense holder.  Since I connect deeply with the ebb and flow of the moon’s cycle, this piece is like a reflection of that.  I burn incense quite often as well… you can never have too many incense holders.  I have one in almost every room of our home.  I love that this one is made by an artist who’s work I already own too.  Now I am growing a little collection from the Garcia Ochoa Family. I have one of their 1,000 Nights vases similar to this one.  And I am swooning over this lamp… I love the earthy shades in it.
    
    This space also contains one of the three nesting bowls from Novica as well.  I am using the other two in different spaces in our house, for different purposes.  I have one in our bathroom that now holds my facewash, and one next to a curio shelf that holds trinkets.  I love how multi purpose they can be.  This one holds my sage, sweetgrass and palo santo.  So many home decor items can be multi-purpose if you look at it in the right way.  I may also use the wooden tealight holder as a ring holder as well.  The pinewood tealight holder and the ceramic tea light nesting bowls are from the same artist as well, Roxana de Papadopolo.  I love her use of ceramics.</p>

    India is one place where they went into elaborate systems of idol-making. This has been misunderstood by other cultures as worshiping some doll as a god. No. Here, people are very much aware that it is we who create the shapes and forms. If you look at it from the standpoint of modern science, we know today that everything is the same energy, but everything is not the same in the world. This energy can be like an animal or this energy can function like the Divine. When I say “the Divine,” I am not talking about you as a being. I am talking about the body itself. The physical body itself can be transformed into a Divine entity if we just reorganize our systems in a particular way.For example, between the full moon day and the new moon day, each of the fourteen nights are so different. Today, we live with so much electric light, so you don't know the difference. Suppose you lived on a farm or in a forest where there was no electricity, then every night would be very different because the moon comes up at different times and it has different shapes and forms. But it is the same moon. It is not a different entity. The same moon has different impacts at different times. Just a little rearrangement, see what a difference it has made.

    Similarly, if you re-arrange the energy system in the body, this body which is just a mass of flesh right now, can become a divine entity. The whole system of yoga is oriented towards this. Gradually, if you give it sufficient attention and practice, you will see that this body is no longer just craving for self-preservation and procreation, it has become something else altogether. It is no longer just a physical entity. Though it is physical, though it is biology, it need not be limited to the physical. It can function and operate in a completely different dimension. Its very presence can become different. It is from this context that many yogis who made their bodies in a certain way, allowed people to worship their bodies. They themselves would not be there in the body, but they let people worship their body because it has become like a divine entity. It is a reorganized energy – completely engineered.
