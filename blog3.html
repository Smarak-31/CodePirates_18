    <p>Making a good tea is hard. From the harvest to the tea-making, tea makers must carefully process every single fresh leaf accordingly. Even the slightest mistake can fall short of success.


        But ruining a good tea is quite easy. Bad storage conditions or bad tea-drinking habits can easily spoil a tea’s true tastes and aromas.
        Advocates of this type of teaware often claim that clay pots can alter and elevate the taste of a tea. Many tea lovers also fall in love with clay pots because of the versatile designs and easy-to-handle shape.


Now, here is the interesting and the tricky part. First of all, yes, unglazed clay pots can “alter” the taste of a tea because the material absorbs flavor overtime. However, whether this “alteration” can elevate the taste depends on how a clay pot is used. Depending on the situation, clay pots can sometimes be more detrimental than instrumental.Because they’re unglazed, clay pots have great breathability. As a result, clay pots can absorb smells from the tea soup. Even after you empty the pot, the smell of the tea still lingers on the walls of the pot.


If a clay pot is dedicated to a single tea, after years or decades of use, it can acquire the essence of that particular tea. In return, it starts to “emit” this smell.


To some teas whose flavor take a long time to present, clay pots can accelerate the flavor-producing process.

    <p>Hand made Red Clay Handi or Earthen Pot with Lid for Cooking with Lid is used for cooking flavorful and authentic curry and gravy dishes. The aesthetic clay pots & Kadai can also be used as a servewareClay cookers allow food to be cooked with minimal additional liquids or fats.

        Individual clay bed are considered to provide specific properties for cooking, and cooking vessels of a particular type often are valued for being made of the traditional type of clay.[5] The micaceous clay found at Taos Pueblo holds heat for a long time.[5] The pots made from this clay are considered to contribute flavor to what is cooked within them.[5]
        
        The clay from Lake Biwa contains tiny fossils which incinerate and produce small pockets of air, which also hold heat.[5] The pots made from this clay are considered to contribute to flavor to what is cooked within them.[4]: 6 
        
        Food & Wine tested multiple dishes in multiple clay pots and said that "In test after test, we found that everything cooked in clay tasted better than the same recipes cooked in metal pans" and that the only drawback to using clay cooking vessels is that they weren't indestructible.Different cultures have different techniques of cooking food in clay pots. Some use pots that are fully finished by burnishing and therefore do not require the pot to be soaked each time before use. Some are unfinished and must be soaked in water for 30–45 minutes before each use to avoid cracking. The design and shape of the pot differ slightly from one culture to another to suit their style of cooking.

        Seasoning is important to prevent cracking of the vessel when exposed to high heat. Clay pots are initially seasoned with oil and hot water but may be fully seasoned only after the first several uses, during which food may take longer to cook. It is also essential to avoid sudden temperature changes, which may cause the pot to crack. Heat should be started low and increased gradually both on the stovetop and in the oven.
        
        The food inside the pot loses little to no moisture because it is surrounded by steam, creating a tender, flavorful dish. Water absorbed within the walls of the pot prevents burning so long as the pot is not allowed to dry completely. Because no oil needs to be added with this cooking technique, food cooked in clay is often lower in fat than food prepared by other methods.

<p>Pottery is one of the famous oldest handicrafts. From prehistoric times, pottery was introduced in a huge amount by using potter’s wheel in various parts of the world. History of Pottery and ceramics still in fashion and make people go crazy about this amazing fact.

Potter used to make different sizes and shapes of ware so that one can easily make use of it and throws it in the earth.
    Pottery has many definitions but…show more content…
    They started making various designer pots and vases. In their time potters was named as craftsmen. They make functional pots and vases so that they can make use objects for drinking and storing wine or either for olive oil. They also decorate their vases and pots by their Greek letters and mythology. The important invention in pottery making was “Potter’s Wheel”. Earlier slow wheel was used by craftsmen but in today world they use fast wheel which is spun on an axle. First they put a lump of clay on the wheel and then they gave a good spin to the wheel and this fast moving wheel helps them to make any type of material and shape. By the help of fast wheel craftsmen get a help in making their material in a faster rate and give their desired shape to the clay.

    Clay is full of paradoxes. It is one of the most technically challenging of art media, and yet is used by the children. Potters must be the first group to be withdrawn from food production and to be engaged in a full time profession of production of earthen vessels. Cooking and storage was a specialized task needing a lot of skill and long training. The potter’s wheel was a momentous invention, ranking along with the mastery over fire, as one of those which most influenced the course of human development. The best pieces of pottery bring out in most of us an almost overwhelming desire to touch, caress and hold them. It is one of the most ancient media, made of the stuff of the earth itself, and yet it is also at the forefront of modern materials science. Historically, Clay has been used to create some of the world’s best art. The tiles of Persian mosques, the sculpture of the early dynasties of china, Pre-Colombian figures in Mesoamerica, the jars of Mycenae, from 2000 B.C., are only few of the best contributions of the history (Peterson, 1995). Clay looks and feels very different in each state of making. Pottery making may appear to be a rather simple, uncomplicated series of steps starting with the mixing of suitable clay with water, forming a shape drying, firing and perhaps glazing. These are the basic steps, but as the potter well knows, there are a number of variables which must be taken in to account within each step as well as the interdependency between any one step and all the others.
